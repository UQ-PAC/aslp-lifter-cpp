# aslp-lifter-cpp
This repository contains source files for an arm lifter, generated by [aslp]'s offline partial evaluation.

## lifter

The generated [`aslp_lifter`][] is a polymorphic C++ class
with a type parameter to support retargeting the lifter to emit different IR targets (e.g. LLVM IR).
The methods which a backend interface must provide are declared in the [`lifter_interface`][]
class and further explained in the next section.

[`aslp_lifter`]: subprojects/aslp-lifter/include/aslp/generated/aslp_lifter.hpp
[`lifter_interface`]: subprojects/aslp-lifter/include/aslp/interface.hpp

The entry point of the lifter is `f_A64_decoder` which decodes the given opcode
and calls a lifter function for that particular encoding (e.g. `f_aarch64_branch_unconditional_immediate`).
Within this lifter function, methods from the lifter interface are called to implement the IR generation.

### interface

The [`lifter_interface`][] is the interface which the generated [`aslp_lifter`][] interacts with.
The [`Traits`][] parameter to lifter_interface defines the fundamental types which the interface operates with.
By providing different implementations of the interface and its traits, the lifter can be _retargeted_
to interpret the semantics in different ways.
For example, [`llvm_interface`][] represents the semantics by emitting LLVM IR, and
other interfaces can be conceived to target other intermediate representations or even emulate the semantics in software.

[`llvm_interface`]: subprojects/aslp-lifter-llvm/include/aslp/llvm_interface.hpp

Within the interface, there is an important distinction between two different stages of evaluation:
- **lift-time** refers to the execution of the lifter's C++ code.
  The [`Traits`][] types concerning lift-time are `::bits` for fixed-length bit-vectors, and `::bigint` for arbitrary-sized integers.
  For example, the opcode is given to the lifter functions as a `::bits` value, so the opcode and anything derived from it is said to be known at lift-time.
  However, anything concerning machine state must be deferred to run-time via the `f_gen_*` methods of [`lifter_interface`][].
- **run-time** refers to the interpretation of the semantics produced during lift-time (e.g. LLVM IR).
  Here, the important types are prefixed with `rt_`:
  `::rt_expr` is the type for ordinary run-time values, `::rt_lexpr` is used for run-time variables, and
  `::rt_label` represents a run-time block.
  Methods which emit code for run-time begin with `f_gen_`.

These two stages are performed in sequence, and we must be careful not to mix up the two.
For example, lift-time information is forgotten at run-time unless explicitly converted.
The `rt_` types are also merely a C++ convenience - they need not be distinct, and they
need not precisely correspond to actual run-time types.
Of course, they should satisfy the C++ type checker, but the lifter will not impose additional expectations on them.

[`Traits`]: subprojects/aslp-lifter/include/aslp/interface.hpp

[`llvm_lifter_traits`][] and [`llvm_interface`][] can be consulted for examples.
The llvm_interface is divided explicitly into lift-time and run-time components.

### usage of headers

The generated lifter template is fairly large.
If included in its entirety, it would take a substantial amount of time and memory to compile.
We alleviate this by splitting the lifter class's header into a forward declaration header,
accompanied with a separate header file for each lifter function definition.

To make use of the lifter in downstream projects, including [`aslp_lifter`][] is sufficient.
This will need to be linked against a library providing the required symbols.

For compiling the library, we provide [subprojects/aslp-lifter/src/generated](subprojects/aslp-lifter/src/generated)
which is a folder of C++ files, each instantiating a single lifter function with a particular [`Traits`][] class.
The traits are defined by a compiler macro, `ASLP_LIFTER_INSTANTIATE`, which should expand to the required Traits class name.
Header files can be included with the `-include` compiler argument.

Examples of this can be seen in the Meson and CMake projects, described below.

## usage

To integrate the lifter with other applications, you can make use of the 
Meson and CMake files in this repository.

In Meson (preferred), we define two subprojects:
- _aslp-lifter_ is the main project, containing the lifter definition in header files and
  source files to support explicit instantiation of the lifter template.
- _aslp-lifter-llvm_ uses the aslp-lifter sources to build a lifter to LLVM.
  It provides a library for users to link against.
- _aslp-lifter-demo_ builds an executable which takes a numeric (big-endian) opcode and
  emits its LLVM semantics. This demonstrates use of the preceding two libraries.

[Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/Running-Meson.html) is very easy to use.
These commands will configure and build the project into a build/ subdirectory.
It is suggested to use Clang, as it is much faster than GCC in our testing.

```bash
CXX=clang++ meson setup build
meson compile -C build
```

The CMakeLists is provided so this repository may be used with FetchContent.
However, it does not make much effort to separate the subprojects, and 
it is not installable.

## generating

At present, this repository is updated manually.
The files are generated by running this command from aslp's directory.
Replace $ASLP_LIFTER_CPP_DIR with this repository's directory:
```bash
echo ':gen A64 .+ cpp $ASLP_LIFTER_CPP_DIR/subprojects/aslp-lifter' | dune exec asli
```
When commiting to Git, make sure to add the `generated` subfolder changes with `-f`.
They are ignored by default to avoid cluttering git output.
